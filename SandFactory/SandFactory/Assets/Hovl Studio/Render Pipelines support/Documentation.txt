The editor replaces shaders in the materials to make effects work with different Rendering Pipelines.
Works only with Hovl Studio assets - https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/28391

Using: 
Go to tab "Tools > Pipeline changer for Hovl Studio assets"
After opening the window, select the desired Render Pipeline.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't forget to enable Depth texture and Opaque texture for URP package if you want correct working of Distortion particles.
Aslo you can not change your URP package settings, but then you need to delete from effects all particles that use Distortion.
Go to Edit/ProjectSettings/Graphics and there you can find your URP package in Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings.
